# :colombia: DevOps  - Load balancer                                      
Letâ€™s improve our web stack so that there is redundancy for our web servers.
This will allow us to be able to accept more traffic by doubling the number 
of web servers, and to make our infrastructure more reliable. If one web 
server fails, we will still have a second one to handle requests.
## Examples
## Prerequisites
- Introduction to load-balancing and HAproxy
- HTTP header
- Debian/Ubuntu HAProxy packages
## Installing
## Built With
All the code was write under ubuntu 14.04
